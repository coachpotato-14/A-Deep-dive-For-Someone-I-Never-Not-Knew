# A-Deep-dive-For-Someone-I-Never-Not-Knew
This work is submitted as my capstone project for ENG 437-Major Authors. The project title was an "Individual Author Deep-Dive", but it is much more than that. I chose my great grandfather, Walt G. Sandberg, he who published two books and many newspaper articles. He who I had met once yet do not remember.
