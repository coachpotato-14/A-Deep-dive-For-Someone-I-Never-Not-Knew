  <h4>To <em>Walt G. Sandberg and Family</em></h4>
  </main>
    <p>I had my head down during class the day the assignment was announced. Deprived of my eight hours, exhausted, and on the edge of napping, Professor Gardsby decreed that “for this assignment, you can pick the author of your choosing.” I jolted awake and swiveled in his direction, knowing exactly who my author would be Walt G. Sandberg, my great-grandfather. This man is not only an author who’s published hundreds of articles along with his two books but is an unknown part of my life that left before I turned two. Even so, I was desperate for more stories, conversations, and time with his written memory. I went as far as to interview my great-grandmother (Carol Sandberg) and their two twin daughters (Lisa Haas and Lori Robinson) to be just a bit closer to him. This course allowed me to gain information for this assignment and to grow closer to the man that I strive to live up to. The only thing that I would have changed or added to this deep-dive was an interview with him, to better understand and kindle the connection that I never had.</p>
    <p>To start this reflective analysis, I wanted to discuss what wasn’t able to be included in this assignment ever so briefly due to what they were; these aren’t any less important. The bulk of the material that I found were old manuscripts, newspaper clippings, index cards, etc. While they were vital for his research, they were not usable because Sandberg did not write them nor were they about his work. However, the time put into collecting such a high volume of media took countless hours of reading and searching along with additional notetaking to reference in future writings. Panning through the pages of scribbles of his work was vital to understanding his thought process when writing just one of his single-paged articles. Despite the endless trough of material, he never took note of anything. All three women, Carol Sandberg, Lisa Haas, and Lori Robinson never saw him take any notes for his writing: “No, he never did” (Lisa Haas), “He kept it all in his head, and then he would come home and write it all down” (Lori Robinson). The only form of notetaking he had was photography, giving him a photographic memory. “He would take pictures to tell the stories cause he always had his camera with him” (Carol Sandberg) and then return to his office and spill the photos across the page. Once in his office, he’d spend day and night using every note and snippet to compile his writings, even if it meant he was a bit isolated.</p>
    <p>Family was the reason he wrote. As stated in <em>The Turn In The Trail</em>, he attributed his writing to his wife and two twin daughters as a thank-you for the support he received from them. All three women say that "[they] are proud of him" (Carol Sandberg, Lisa Hass, Lori Robinson). The family of four often took rustic camping trips in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota's wilderness, spending most weekends out of the house. Sandberg took his trips as opportunities to take the photos he would later reference in articles, such as <em>Exploring Michigan's Porcupine Mountains</em> article. This magazine features a a tenderly written story of his family’s experience camping in the Porcupine Mountains accompanied by pictures that featured both his daughters and wife. He spoke of the thousands of acres of wilderness, rentable cabins, and the well-preserved and lengthy trails that decorated the mountainside. One paragraph in particular encapsulated the purpose of this article. This paragraph reassures parents to “[now worry about the kids… Our twin daughters… have been camping out since they were in diapers… and now they race up and down the Porcupine Mountains… while my wife Carol and I struggle” (Exploring Michigan’s Porcupine Mountains, Sandberg). This excerpt from this paragraph portrays this adventure as a playful and spunky family outing, making a great basis for his family theme by connecting himself and his wife to their joyful daughters within a natural space.</p>
    <p>As his family was his main motivation for writing, the memories that were created brought back past experiences. These cherished pieces are preserved in his writings, specifically in <em>BACK TO JUST PLAIN FISHIN'</em>, jumping back to Sandberg and his father fishing at their favorite weed bed and his feelings of growing out of them. Sandberg begins with the original memory, rowing his father and himself to their favorite weed bed in a “leaky $3-a-day rental boat to leisurely fish for Lake Michigan perch” (PLAIN FISHIN’, Sandberg). He reviews the new embellishments atop this memory and how he’s supposedly improved upon it, adding new bells and whistles to his shiny new tackle collection. Instead of just plain fishin’, he goes “streamer fishing, dry fly fishing, ultra-light spinning, wire-line or downrigger trolling,” displaying his grown-up knowledge of the basic fishing skills (PLAIN FISHIN’, Sandberg). He then realizes that he’s lost it, the bare essence of that memory with his father. Using these lavish and brand-name tackle, “fishing no longer seems to be the pleasure it used to be” (JUST PLAIN FISHIN’, Sandberg). Sometimes, the things we experience in childhood can no longer be brought back to their pure state. We think that, as we grow older, we can add shiny trinkets and embellishments to these memories to make them more enjoyable and perfect, but it never lasts. By the time we realize it, we are yearning for what we had before, the raw memory. But sometimes, there isn’t enough of that memory’s essence to bring its feeling back to us in the present time. We desperately want to recreate it but don’t want to force it to happen; it will never be the same, “for Dad’s gone, too, you see” (PLAIN FISHIN’, Sandberg).</p>
