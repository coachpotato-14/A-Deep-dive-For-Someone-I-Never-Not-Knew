  <h4>To <em>Walt G. Sandberg and Family</em></h4>
  </main>
    <p>Head down on the table, not paying much heed to the discussions in class, until the day the assignment was announced. Deprived of my eight hours, exhausted, and on the edge of napping, Professor Gardsby decreed that “for this assignment, you can pick the author of your choosing.” I jolted awake and swiveled in his direction, knowing exactly who my author would be Walt G. Sandberg, my great-grandfather. This man is not only an author who’s published hundreds of articles along with his two books but is an unknown part of my life that left before I turned two. Even so, I was desperate for more stories, conversations, and time with his written memory. I went as far as to interview my great-grandmother (Carol Sandberg) and their two twin daughters (Lisa Haas and Lori Robinson) to be just a bit closer to him. This course allowed me to gain information for this assignment and to grow closer to the man that I strive to live up to. The only thing that I would have changed or added to this deep-dive was an interview with him, to better understand and kindle the connection that I never had. However, I can infer that if I were to ever find such a relic, it would provide crucial insight to who my great-grandfather was, putting a voice to the man that I never once knew. </p>
    <p>To start this reflective analysis, I wanted to discuss what wasn’t able to be included in this assignment ever so briefly due to what they were; these aren’t any less important. The bulk of the material that I found were old manuscripts, newspaper clippings, index cards, etc. While they were vital for his research, they were not usable because Sandberg did not write them nor were they about his work. However, the time put into collecting such a high volume of media took countless hours of reading and searching along with additional notetaking to reference in future writings. Panning through the pages of scribbles of his work was vital to understanding his thought process when writing just one of his single-paged articles. Despite the endless trough of material, he never took note of anything. All three women, Carol Sandberg, Lisa Haas, and Lori Robinson never saw him take any notes for his writing: “No, he never did” (Lisa Haas), “He kept it all in his head, and then he would come home and write it all down” (Lori Robinson). The only form of notetaking he had was photography, giving him a photographic memory. “He would take pictures to tell the stories cause he always had his camera with him” (Carol Sandberg) and then return to his office and spill the photos across the page. Once in his office, he’d spend day and night using every note and snippet to compile his writings, even if it meant he was a bit isolated.</p>
    <p>Family was the reason he wrote. As stated in <em>The Turn In The Trail</em>, he attributed his writing to his wife and two twin daughters as a thank-you for the support he received from them. All three women say that "[they] are proud of him" (Carol Sandberg, Lisa Hass, Lori Robinson). The family of four often took rustic camping trips in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota's wilderness, spending most weekends out of the house. Sandberg took his trips as opportunities to take the photos he would later reference in articles, such as <em>Exploring Michigan's Porcupine Mountains</em> article. This magazine features a a tenderly written story of his family’s experience camping in the Porcupine Mountains accompanied by pictures that featured both his daughters and wife. He spoke of the thousands of acres of wilderness, rentable cabins, and the well-preserved and lengthy trails that decorated the mountainside. One paragraph in particular encapsulated the purpose of this article. This paragraph reassures parents to “[now worry about the kids… Our twin daughters… have been camping out since they were in diapers… and now they race up and down the Porcupine Mountains… while my wife Carol and I struggle” (Exploring Michigan’s Porcupine Mountains, Sandberg). This excerpt from this paragraph portrays this adventure as a playful and spunky family outing, making a great basis for his family theme by connecting himself and his wife to their joyful daughters within a natural space.</p>
    <p>As his family was his main motivation for writing, the memories that were created brought back past experiences. These cherished pieces are preserved in his writings, specifically in <em>BACK TO JUST PLAIN FISHIN'</em>, jumping back to Sandberg and his father fishing at their favorite weed bed and his feelings of growing out of them. Sandberg begins with the original memory, rowing his father and himself to their favorite weed bed in a “leaky $3-a-day rental boat to leisurely fish for Lake Michigan perch” (PLAIN FISHIN’, Sandberg). He reviews the new embellishments atop this memory and how he’s supposedly improved upon it, adding new bells and whistles to his shiny new tackle collection. Instead of just plain fishin’, he goes “streamer fishing, dry fly fishing, ultra-light spinning, wire-line or downrigger trolling,” displaying his grown-up knowledge of the basic fishing skills (PLAIN FISHIN’, Sandberg). He then realizes that he’s lost it, the bare essence of that memory with his father. Using these lavish and brand-name tackle, “fishing no longer seems to be the pleasure it used to be” (JUST PLAIN FISHIN’, Sandberg). Sometimes, the things we experience in childhood can no longer be brought back to their pure state. We think that, as we grow older, we can add shiny trinkets and embellishments to these memories to make them more enjoyable and perfect, but it never lasts. By the time we realize it, we are yearning for what we had before, the raw memory. But sometimes, there isn’t enough of that memory’s essence to bring its feeling back to us in the present time. We desperately want to recreate it but don’t want to force it to happen; it will never be the same, “for Dad’s gone, too, you see” (PLAIN FISHIN’, Sandberg).</p>
    <p>The cherishing of memories and family were both notable themes that influenced his work, along with nature, but his writing style is what led to such simple and informative articles. The “common” language that Sandberg uses had seemed primitive to me, but he uses this diction to accommodate his audience. The majority of his work was geared towards sportsmen who partook in fishing, hunting, and other activities dealing with the outdoors. In every article that I’d read, there was simplistic imagery and an intimate story-telling tone. Sandberg’s use of simple syntax and word choice created a comforting environment that was easily understood even when using terminology geared for sportsmen who hunt and fish. While interviewing Lisa Haas (my aunt/Sandberg’s daughter), she explained how “He knew their general intellect… These people weren’t university professors” who had extensive vocabulary outside of hunting and fishing terminology (Lisa Haas). To Sandberg, it was important to understand the audience and what verbiage was appropriate for that specific group of people. If he had used “fancy” words, his audience would not clearly grasp his readings and would quickly lose interest. The only “fancy” words that were seen in his articles were sport-specific terminology and statistical information that would better inform his fellow sportsmen. For instance, in his article <em>A Fins & Feathers Guide to Grouse Hunting in 75'</em>, he included specific acreage numbers, important for seasonal hunting of grouse, and population numbers to better prepare hunters for the yearly escapade. For example, “nearby, wood county’s sandhill area, 9,455 acres, and Wood county public hunting grounds, 19,303 acres (No. 8 on map,) should be almost as good” (Guide to Grouse Hunting, Sandberg). His geographical knowledge of these locations shows how much he cares about giving the correct information to fellow sportsmen to properly prepare themselves for the season upcoming in specific areas. Again, in the <em>COHO CALENDAR</em>, Sandberg’s knowledge of salmon populations, price, and migrating patterns is necessary information for sportsmen who fish these animals. For example, “Most coho gain up to a pound each week on their June to September feeding spree. Young “jack” salmon will average only 15-inches and 1-1/2 pounds. Mature fish will average 27-inches and 9-1/2 pounds. Top specimens will reach 30-inches and 15-pounds or more” (COHO CALENDAR, Sandberg). This knowledge is collected personally by him through years of self-conducted research to produce the most accurate guide for other sportsmen.</p>
    <p>To add one last piece to this, although without another source to add, I want to talk about the lack of audio/video-recordings of Sandberg. As I reflected upon the comment made on the original paper, I felt that this had already been answered in a way. “[He] was very introverted and shy”, so I understood why he never had any external interviews or conversations with anyone, but I wish that there was more to this story (Lori Robinson). If there had been, I could have connected with him more, understood why he was so quiet, but I won’t ever know the answer because I’ve only ever met the man when I was but a baby. The only frame of reference that I have is the picture of his 60-ish-year-old self on the inside of his book covers. I can imagine him being very raspy and rustic, warm yet harsh. For the sake of the assignment, I didn’t have much time to find anything more than what I’ve already collected, but if it exists somewhere out there, I hope that one day I can find it.</p>
    <p>Putting the assignment aside, this is more than the research, transcribing, and collecting. I will never meet my great-grandfather, maybe in another life or somewhere a bit more divine if it exists. All I have to go by is his writing. These pieces of him were meant for me to find and use for this assignment to better understand the man that I never knew. Not only was this emotional for me but also for the three women that I interviewed: My great-grandmother, Carol Sandberg; great-aunt, Lisa Haas; grandmother, Lori Robinson. The interviews created such a strong connection between the three of us that it brought us all to tears. It hurt me to see each of them upset that he isn’t here, especially since he couldn’t tell me himself, but they all felt that it was important enough to revisit them. If I could change one thing about this assignment, I would wish to meet him, even just once, to hear him out personally. To listen to all his stories about his writing, family, and how he would feel about me, the only great-grandchild that he’d ever met. I can only hope to be any bit of the writer he was. I would want to know what drove him to be a writer, what he thought about his family living along side his writing life, how he researched for the impressively long book about Iwo Jima, and what he thought of his first great-grandchild and what he wished for her. I won’t every know any of these answers, but I can imagine that he would be proud of me, in some regard at least. I want to be more, to hold on to what little memory I have left of him to create literature and stories as powerful as his are. If only he could have read my first published poem or heard all the stories that were trapped in my own crazy mind. All I can do with these streams is to follow the turn in the trail and hope to be any bit of the writer he was. </p>
